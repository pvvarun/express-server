## MERN STACK
## 1.INTRODUCTION
* MERN stack is great for developing a complete web application, and takes the reader through all that is necessary to get that done.
* **MERN**  is an acronym for **_MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js_**

## 2.COMPONENTS
### MongoDB 
* MongoDB, as previously mentioned, is one of the most popular NoSQL database management systems. It is document-oriented, has a flexible schema, and has a JSON based query language.
### Express
* Writing a server on Node is not very easy, so enter the Express framework. Express lets you define routes, align them to HTTP requests (get, post, patch, put, delete requests to a particular route) and define a series of actions to take when that route is hit.
### React js
* React provides the reactive user interface of your application. It  utilize components, are reactive in that the user gets immediate feedback as it interacts with the application, and typically run within a user’s browser.
### Node.js
* The most simple definition, Node.js is Javascript outside of a browser. Node provides a runtime environment for Javascript, much like a browser, but in its own world.

## 3.ADVANTAGES
* The essence of the MERN stack, is to build websites with rich experiences similar to desktop and mobile apps
* The advantage MERN stack provides for a Software developer is that every line of code is written in JavaScript and there’s no need for context switching.
